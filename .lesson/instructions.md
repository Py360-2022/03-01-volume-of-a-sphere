 The volume of a sphere with a radius r  [4/3 * pi r^3](assets/formula-volume-sphere.JPG) 

  1. Write the code for a program that asks the user for the diameter then prints the volume of the sphere 
  ___the input is diameter but the formula requires radius `r` so you will have to convert___
  2. for the value of `pi` use  3.14159 (for now)
  3. For test data calculate the volume of you should get given a diameter of 6.65 cm ; make sure your code returns the correct result.  Feel free to google for a calculator to get the result, or diy!  
  
__ Remember always begin your code with__
```python
# description of the program
# your name
# the date
```
